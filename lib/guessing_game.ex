defmodule Games.GuessingGame do
  @moduledoc """
  Guessing game played on the CLI after a call to `Games.GuessingGame.play/0`
  """

  @doc """
  Generates a random number from 1 to 10, player wins on correct guess.

  Starts a recursive call to `play_rec/2` to abstract away `target`.
  `target` stores the initial rolled value.
  `attempts` tracks 5 attempts before player loses.

  ## Examples

      iex> Games.GuessingGame.play()
      Guess a number between 1 and 10: 3
      You win!
